EcmaScript : ECMAScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262. It's commonly implemented as JavaScript in web browsers and other environments. ECMAScript provides the rules and guidelines that JavaScript (and similar languages like JScript and ActionScript) follow.
JavaScript : JavaScript is a scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's the most widely known ans used implementation of ECMAScript. JavaScript includes additional features that are not part of the ECMAScript specification, like the DOM manipulation, which is crucial for web development but is not defined by ECMAScript.
Node.js : Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side and networking applications using JavaScript. Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome, to execute code.
