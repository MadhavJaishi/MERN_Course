Json web tokens(JWT)
JWT converts an object into a very long string which is neither hashed nor protected in any way. So anyone who get that long string, can retrieve the original data.
It's technically a digital signature. Anyone can see the original output given the signature. Signature can be verified only using the password.
The token can be stored in the localStorage of the brower which can be seen if - Inspect - Application - localStorage.
